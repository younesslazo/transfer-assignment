# How to use `git`
1. Initialize a repository with `git`
2. Stage your files with `git add <file>`
3. Whenever you made a substantial change, put it into the history with `git commit -m "Commit message"`
4. See your history with `git log`
5. Move around (history and branches!) with `git checkout <commit/branch>`
6. Create new branches with `git branch <branch-name>`
7. To collaborate, first `git fetch` others changes, then `git merge` yours
